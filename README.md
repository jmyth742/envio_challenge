# envio_challenge

Challenge one is gpioApp.py and gpio.sh, python was chosen for the CLI and then usual bash script. 

Challenge2 is written simply in  (arraySort.cpp) cpp, random generator test case is present when debug flagged.

challenge3 is challenge3.dts - this one is maybe a little bit rusty, as i had not worked with dts in around 2years.
